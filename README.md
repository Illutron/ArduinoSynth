ArduinoSynth
============

This is a fork of Illutron's ArduinoSynth repo.

What's to be added is:

-Basic documentation  
-Compatibility with other boards (originally only compatible with ATmega328/128 based Arduino boards)  
-Choosing output pin manually, although only PWM (originally fixed to pin 6)
